# read_pe
A Go program to parse PE files.  
I am writing this program in order to improve my knowledge of the PE file format and to learn the Golang programming language.
## Ideas for future developments
* Detect PE anomalies and repair them
* Split in multiple source files (extract helper functions to make a library)
* Include the ELF format
* GUI
